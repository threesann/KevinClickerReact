  "Kevster Clicker is a 2024 web-based browser clicker game developed by Snooker Inc, a subsidiary of Burgerbross S.p z.o.o in HTML5 and CSS3. The game was developed in only a week while the dev team drank milk and ate oat cookies all day long. The game was directed by elusive auteur Rishabh Sandhu, who commanded the submissive yet talented developer David Fiddles to develop the game for him while he merely laid out the assets and designed some kick-ass music. Since Rishabh only had his brain implanted 2 years prior at the age of 15 by the Mind Monks of Tanzania, he couldn't think up any of the game's concepts by himself at all. It was impossible. So, he manipulated and gaslit talented mind user Leon Carpin into conceptualising various upgrades, trinkets and doodads for him to use. Famously, he paid Leon Carpin a Half Penny and 2 Farthings in the Lord's Currency. The team hired two goblins from a deep chasm known as Daniels and Harry to design assets and playtest the game, which they obliged to, so long as the devteam consistently supplied them with the bones of a chicken every new moon. In what is now pop culture history, the game's development abruptly ended when the development team was found universally guilty of intergalactic fraud on 6302 counts after failing to repay loans to the Coalition of Mars, which they had taken out to fund the game's development. The team are now serving individual sentences of 1300 years in a quantum jail in Pennsylvania. The game released on August 12, 2026.",
